# Final System can be built in a directory and later copied to a partition.
# If building on a seperate partition, create the file system and mount it.
# Set #MLFS to the mount point. Example:
# Perform as root:
mkfs.etx4 /dev/sda4
mkdir -pv /mnt/mlfs
mount /dev/sda4 /mnt/mlfs
export MLFS=/mnt/mlfs

# Create directories to build tools and link them to host's root directory:
mkdir -v $MLFS/cross-tools
mkdir -v $MLFS/tools
ln -sv   $MLFS/cross-tools /
ln -sv   $MLFS/tools /

# Create directories to hold patches, files, packages, and build area:
mkdir -pv $MLFS/sources/{patches,files}

# Download sources + patches
#  Use the list in sources folder with wget to download sources. Some sources 
#  may not download or are hard to find. Copy such sources from included 
#  sources folder.
# 
# Source directory should have this structure:
#  source
#  |
#  +-scripts
#  +-patches
#  +-files
#  +-(packages)
#
# Source tarballs should in root of $LFS/sources
# Patches & files can be symbolically linked to root of $LFS/sources to avoid 
# adding "../{patches,files}" to path

# Create user and group
# Change ownership to allow installation of tools
